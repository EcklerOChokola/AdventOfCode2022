# AdventOfCode2022

This repository was made to present my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022. These run on Node.js, and each directory reprensents one day.

**Beware : These solutions technically work, but are not intended to be optimised nor examples to follow. Code is not at all commented and can have edge-cases !**

## Run

If you want to run a day, simply go to the corresponding directory, then copy your `input.txt` inside it. Then, you simply have to run : 

```
npm install
node script.js
```

And the results shall appear in the console.
